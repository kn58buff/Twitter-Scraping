2018-11-27T07:26:13.000Z,"Many more opportunities are also available in water supply, sanitation and waste management~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:25:58.000Z,"In Kenya, a number cities and towns are located along our coast, lakes and rivers. Mombasa and Kisumu, in particular, offer investments opportunities in renewable energy, tourism, fish processing and storage, maritime transport &amp; shipping, among ~ @UKenyatta others #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:25:20.000Z,"This Conference is, therefore, timely.  Your diverse experiences, challenges and success stories are crucial as we work together, government and non-governmental entities alike~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:24:59.000Z,We need to devise new and innovative ways of engaging the creativity of our citizens in order to tap into their genius and innovations~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe
2018-11-27T07:24:41.000Z,"Fourth, strong accountability and transparency mechanisms are an imperative. Societies thrive when they are open and transparent, and when public participation in policy and decision making is optimal~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:24:03.000Z,"Similarly, we should innovate and deploy renewables to make our buildings, transport and industries more energy efficient~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:23:43.000Z,"Although sea levels will not rise instantaneously, the calculated increases will be “locked in” at a temperature rise of 3C, meaning they will be irreversible even if warming eventually slows down~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:23:28.000Z,Scientists estimate that 275 million people worldwide live in areas that will eventually be flooded at 3C of global warming~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe
2018-11-27T07:23:10.000Z,"One of the biggest resulting threats to cities around the world is sea-level rise, caused by the expansion of water at higher temperatures and melting ice sheets on the north and south poles~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:22:51.000Z,"Pollution and waste management is the greatest threat from our cities.  Inefficient transport systems and buildings produce about 50% of the Green House Gases, contributing significantly to undesirable climate change~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:22:36.000Z,"Third, we need to protect the environment.  We must continue protecting and preserving public green spaces~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:22:16.000Z,We need liveable neighbourhoods where design encourages people to walk or cycle or use efficient and affordable public transport~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe
2018-11-27T07:21:53.000Z,"Second, we need to improve the resilience of communities.  Our grand vision should not be just about building cities and towns, but rather also about creating jobs and liveable neighbourhoods by our communities~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:21:36.000Z,"We, therefore, urgently need to give priority to resource use implications and environmental impacts of urbanization.  In planning the cities, we need to make them more compact to avoid urban slump and economize on the land under concrete~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:21:15.000Z,"Natural landscapes and habitats are altered, the floodplains around estuaries are built over; increasing volumes of waste, particularly sewage, are sluiced out into coastal waters; and soils and beach sands are often overexploited, all at great economic and ecological cost."
2018-11-27T07:21:03.000Z,"As more people crowd into coastal areas, they put pressure on both land and sea ~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:20:40.000Z,"First is sustainability; the challenge is both clear and urgent. Two-thirds of the global population is expected to live in cities by 2050. Further, urban areas account for 70 percent of the emissions that are propelling the planet into a climate unknown @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:20:18.000Z,Let me highlight four areas we should focus on to address the challenges we face in our urban areas ~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKE
2018-11-27T07:19:43.000Z,"For example, over 748 million people lack access to clean and safe water for drinking Another 2.5 billion around the world lack decent sanitation systems ~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:19:24.000Z,"But our cities and towns are also experiencing serious challenges, which threaten to slow down their vibrancy and growth potential ~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:18:55.000Z,"This is because there are many transport, food and ecological benefits.  Products traditionally flow into countries through their ports.  This has set a precedence for populations to naturally migrate towards coastal areas~ @UKenyatta #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:18:28.000Z,"The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that half the world’s population lives within 60 kilometers of the sea.  Historically, cities have been located on coastlines; indeed, eight of the top ten largest cities in the world are coast located #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:18:04.000Z,"They provide jobs to millions of people and as multicultural and multiracial centres, they foster cross-cultural integration.  Properly planned urban spaces are vessels for innovation and technological transmission #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T07:17:38.000Z,"We all know, cities and towns hold the greatest promise as well as the greatest challenge for the future of human existence.  They are the most vibrant economic zones and, in aggregate, they generate about seventy five percent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) #BlueEconomyKe"
2018-11-27T06:58:18.000Z,"President @UKenyatta and other Heads of State &amp;  Government, arrive at KICC for the second day of the #BlueEconomyKe Conference.

2018-11-26T07:29:50.000Z,"I make this pledge in recognition of the need to:
(i)Adopt appropriate policies, strategies and mechanisms to harness the blue economy to re-energize our national economies and create greater opportunities and jobs for our people; - @UKenyatta"
2018-11-26T07:28:55.000Z,"I am convinced that for the sake of the present and future generations and for the continued viability of our ecosystems, we have to envision a different future and, therefore, a different model for the blue economy.  I pledge to envision that future and do my part to promote it."
2018-11-26T07:28:37.000Z,"To this end, therefore, I am here to make a personal pledge - @UKenyatta"
2018-11-26T07:28:17.000Z,"Success in managing our global aquatic resources for sustainable global development, therefore, critically hinges on us working together - @UKenyatta"
2018-11-26T07:27:59.000Z,But such action must be collective. Two-thirds of global waters lie beyond national jurisdiction.  Action in one sea will have a positive or negative effect on other seas - @UKenyatta
2018-11-26T07:27:39.000Z,"We have convened here today to commit to innovative and transformative ways of using and sustaining our oceans, seas, lakes and rivers.  We know unless our environmental riches are protected, there can be no lasting prosperity for any of us - @UKenyatta"
2018-11-26T07:27:19.000Z,"But we have also witnessed how progressive actions, by some of the countries represented here, to sustainably use, nurture and protect marine resources (Canada and Seychelles are good examples) have enabled these countries to develop vibrant, diversified and inclusive economies."
2018-11-26T07:26:49.000Z,"We are already experiencing the impact of climate change, which risks triggering rising temperatures that would flood and destroy large sections of our coastal economies - @UKenyatta"
2018-11-26T07:26:28.000Z,We are already feeling the impact of plastics in oceans.  The eight million tons of plastics that enter the sea each year are transformed into microplastics that enter into the food chain and impact ecosystems as well as animal and human health worldwide - @UKenyatta
2018-11-26T07:26:07.000Z,"As a result, many of the ocean systems are under immense stress.  Their ability to act as a climate regulator and as a key engine for economic growth and sustainable development, is progressively being eroded - @UKenyatta"
2018-11-26T07:25:46.000Z,"Unfortunately, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have paid inadequate attention to the impact of human action on the health and productivity of our waters - @UKenyatta"

2018-11-26T07:24:46.000Z,"Like all of you, I am excited by the enormous economic prospects of the blue economy.  At the same time, I am also deeply concerned about the challenges of sustainable use of this critical resource  - @UKenyatta"
